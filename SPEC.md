# HTTP Server - Take-Home Test

## Background

**Ancelotti** is our in-house proxy software that routes customer traffic through our proxies. **Carlo** handles all business logic for that to happen, which includes authentication, geographic targeting, and proxy selection at high throughput. These two services communicate over HTTP/1.1 with JSON payloads. 

In this take-home test, you'll build a simplified version of Carlo's auth and routing pipeline. This will give you hands-on experience with the architectural patterns we use in production while keeping the scope manageable.

---

## Overview

Create an HTTP server with two endpoints:
1. **Auth Service** - Validate user credentials and parse routing parameters from the username
2. **Route Service** - Select a proxy based on the user selected parameters and a protocol

### The Context

The **Context** is the central data structure that flows through the request pipeline. It accumulates state as the request passes through each service stage.

In a real proxy server, a request flows through multiple stages: Auth → Route → Bind → Report. Each stage enriches the context with its results, passing it to the next stage. The context acts as a carrier for all request-related data.

For this test:
1. The client calls `/auth` with credentials
2. Auth validates the user and parses routing parameters from the username
3. Auth returns a **Context** containing the parsed parameters
4. The client calls `/route` with the context from auth
5. Route uses the parameters in the context to select a proxy

This pattern decouples authentication from routing logic while maintaining a clear data flow and gives great observability in production.

## API Specification


### POST /auth

Authenticate a user and parse routing parameters from the username.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "username": "alice_residential_c_us_city_new_york",
  "password": "secretpass123"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "auth_service": {
      "proxy_user_id": "alice_residential",
      "available_bandwidth": 10737418240,
      "residential_params": {
        "country": "us",
        "city": "new_york"
      }
    }
  },
  "available_bandwidth": 10737418240
}
```

**Error Response (401):**
```json
{
  "internal_error_code": 1001,
  "error_message": "invalid password"
}
```

**Username Format:**

```
<proxy_user_id>[_c_<country>[_city_<city>]]
```

- `proxy_user_id` is the user ID in the database. It can contain underscores, for example `alice_residential`.
- `_c_<country>` is optional. `country` is a lowercase ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, for example `us`.
- `_city_<city>` is optional. It must come after `_c_<country>`. `city` is lowercase and can contain underscores, for example `new_york`.
- A username with `_city_` but no `_c_` is invalid.

Examples:

| Username | proxy_user_id | country | city |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alice_residential` | `alice_residential` | - | - |
| `alice_residential_c_gb` | `alice_residential` | `gb` | - |
| `alice_residential_c_us_city_new_york` | `alice_residential` | `us` | `new_york` |
| `alice_residential_city_new_york` | invalid | | |

When the username has no routing parameters, leave out `residential_params` from the context.

**Bandwidth:** A user with `available_bandwidth` of 0 cannot authenticate. Auth must reject the user with error 1002.

### POST /route

Select a proxy based on the context from auth.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "auth_service": {
      "proxy_user_id": "alice_residential",
      "available_bandwidth": 10737418240,
      "residential_params": {
        "country": "us",
        "city": "new_york"
      }
    }
  },
  "protocol": "http"
}
```

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "context": {
    "auth_service": {
      "proxy_user_id": "alice_residential",
      "available_bandwidth": 10737418240,
      "residential_params": {
        "country": "us",
        "city": "new_york"
      }
    },
    "route_service": {
      "proxy_addr": {
        "ip": "192.168.1.1",
        "port": 8080
      },
      "protocol": "http"
    }
  },
  "proxy_addr": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.1",
    "port": 8080
  }
}
```

**Routing Logic:**
1. If an exact country + city match exists, return it
2. If no city match, fallback to any proxy in that country
3. If no country match, return error
4. If no routing parameters specified, select a random proxy
5. All results need to support the chosen protocol

**Error Response (404):**
```json
{
  "internal_error_code": 3400,
  "error_message": "no proxy found for country"
}
```

### Error Codes

All errors use the same body as the examples above: `internal_error_code` and `error_message`. You can add more codes for other failures. If you do, list them in your README.

| Endpoint | HTTP Status | internal_error_code | error_message | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/auth` | 400 | 1000 | `invalid username format` | The username does not match the username format |
| `/auth` | 401 | 1001 | `invalid password` | The password is incorrect |
| `/auth` | 403 | 1002 | `no available bandwidth` | The user has `available_bandwidth` of 0 |
| `/auth` | 401 | 1003 | `user not found` | No user has this `proxy_user_id` |
| `/route` | 400 | 3001 | `unsupported protocol` | The protocol is not `http` or `socks5` |
| `/route` | 404 | 3400 | `no proxy found for country` | No proxy in the country supports the protocol |

## Database Setup

A PostgreSQL database is provided via Docker Compose. Start it with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Connection details:
- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `ping_residential`
- User: `ping_dev`
- Password: `localdev`

## Evaluation Criteria

### Areas of Focus

Ping focuses on fast and reliable proxying. We're evaluating whether you can take a set of business requirements and design a maintainable and extensible system.

- **Code structure** - Clean separation of concerns, easy to navigate and extend
- **Error handling** - We want to easily debug any issues that arise in production
- **Business requirements** - How you've interpreted and implemented the spec
- **Performance** - Consideration for efficiency and scale

### How We Score

We score your solution in three tiers. You must meet a tier before the next tier counts.

1. **Working** - The server starts with the instructions in your README. Both endpoints meet the spec, including the routing rules and the error codes. We test this with our own set of requests.
2. **Clean and extensible** - Handlers, business logic and database access are separate. Errors are consistent and easy to debug. It is easy to add a new routing parameter, such as state targeting.
3. **Ready for future changes** - Your design can support features that the spec does not ask for, such as rate limiting for each user, or routing rules that change in the future. You can build these features or describe them in your README or in TODO comments. We value clear reasons and trade-offs more than the number of features.

### Trade-Offs

We're happy for you to cut corners to avoid scope creep. If you do, please leave comments in your code explaining what you would do differently with more time. 

You can do this using TODO comments such as the one below 

```
// TODO add db connection pooling. 
// Currently creates a DB connection per request
// I would use pgx pool library to implement this https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/pgxpool

```
 
### Questions

If anything in the spec is ambiguous, please ask for clarification. We welcome questions and won't judge you for asking them. That said, we do expect you to make reasonable assumptions and figure out implementation details on your own.

**Good question:** "Should I support all types of residential params (ASN, state, zip code, etc.)?"

**Answer:** For this test, just support country and city params.

**Bad question:** "How do I connect to PostgreSQL in Go?"

## Use of AI

You can use AI tools for this test. If you use AI, you must still be able to explain every line of your code as if you wrote it yourself. We will check this in the follow-up conversation.

---

## Timing

We don't expect you to spend more than **3 hours** on this task. A working solution that covers the core requirements is more valuable than a polished but incomplete one.

That said, we do expect you to come prepared with ideas about how you would improve or extend your implementation given more time. We'll discuss these in the follow-up conversation.

---

## Deliverables

Please submit your solution as a GitHub repository (public or private, your choice).

Include a README with:
- Instructions on how to run the server
- Any assumptions you made
